# Jungle Dash
A COMP305 - 3 Group 3 project

# Protection Rules
You cannot push updates directly to the main branch.<br>
Instead, create a new branch, make those changes, and then create a pull request.<br>
This way **EVERYONE MUST APPROVE OF THE CHANGES** before it goes to the main branch.

[I (Johnathan)](https://github.com/gtaEPIC) can manage making some of the branches and issues,
but if you know how as well that would be great.

Please ask me if you need help with the repository.
